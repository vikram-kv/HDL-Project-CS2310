# HDL-Projects-CS2310
### Hack ALU and Hack Computer are described using the beginner's HDL nand2tetris. The software is open-source and is available [here](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).

This project was done as part of the lab course _CS2310 - Foundatons of Computer Systems Design Lab_ in the Jul - Nov 2020 Semester under Dr. C. Chandra Sekhar.

A hack ALU that supports the increment by 1, decrement by 1, negation, complementation, addition, subtraction, bitwise OR and bitwise AND on 16-bit signed operands was built first. This ALU was then used to used to build the hack CPU which was in turn used along with RAM(Data memory only) and ROM(Instruction memory only) to build the Hack Computer(Computer.hdl). The instruction set of the CPU is described in chapters 4 and 5 of the book [The Elements of Computing Systems: 
Building a Modern Computer from First Principles](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-computing-systems-second-edition#:~:text=In%20the%20process%2C%20learners%20gain,and%20algorithms%2C%20and%20software%20engineering). The tools for using our code : An assembler, CPUEmulator and Hardware Simulator are all available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xZzcMIUETv3u3sdpM_oTJSTetpVee3KZ) as part of the nand2tetris software package along with some cool projects.

# Test Instances

The test cases for the Hack Computer are given under *Test Cases* in the *Hack Computer* folder. All tools required for running are available in the nand2tetris software package and need a Java Run-time Environment to function. A thorough reading of the book given above is suggested examining this project.
